He asks clarifying questions when he's unsure, and he pays very good attention to detail. 
He talks through his process while coding and I heard him talk over all the different corner cases, etc.
His code was clean and well structured." </span>- Triplebyte Interviewer</div><h2>Hello World!</h2><span>My name is Kyle Spencer. I am a student at
The Pennsylvania State University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. 
I intend to graduate in May 2019 and enter a career in programming.</span><br><br><span>I have been programming as a hobby since I was 13, when I discovered my interest in programming and computers. 
Most fields of programming interest me; however, the area I enjoy most is full stack web development.
Creating side projects is my favorite pass-time, allowing me to tinker with new technologies and make interesting new things. I have created
many projects I am proud of, including a bare metal x86 shell, and a static web server. These projects and more can be found on my </span><a href="projects.html">project page. </a><br><br><span>I am fairly involved with the programming scene here at 
Penn State. I attend ACM meetings, coding competitions, 
and hackathons. My team and I won 3rd place at the HackPSU
Fall 2017 hackathon with our crypto-currency payment app </span><a href="https://github.com/kylecs/hackpsu-fall-2017">Krypt!</a><br><br><h2>My Resume</h2><a href="resume.pdf">You can download my resume here.</a></div></body></html>
