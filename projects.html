I create
these either to learn about a specific field in programming, to become more
familiar with a language, or just because I find it fun.
</p><span class="projecttitle">x86 Bare Metal Shell </span><a href="https://github.com/kylecs/Kernel">(source code)</a><br><br><img class="projectimage" src="res/imgs/kernel.gif"><p>This project is a program that runs directly on x86 hardware
to provide a low level shell. Interrupts are used to respond
to the keyboard and the screen is controlled via
memory mapped io.</p><p>I created this project with C and x86 assembly. The code
is compiled, assembled, and linked without any external libraries.
The linked object is then either run in a QEMU emulator or built
into an ISO for use on real hardware.
</p><br><span class="projecttitle">Rust HTTP Server </span><a href="https://github.com/kylecs/rust-http-server">(source code)</a><br><p>This is an HTTP/1.1 web server written in Rust. It complies with the RFC specification
and has full support for serving static websites.</p><p>I created this project to become more familiar with HTTP and also
to get some experience using Rust.
</p><br><span class="projecttitle">Earth Image Timelapse </span><a href="https://github.com/kylecs/earth-timelapse">(source code)</a><br><br><img class="projectimage" src="res/imgs/earthtimelapse.gif"><p>This is a script that uses NASA's Earth Image API to get all 
public satellite images from given coordinates over a given time
period. Images are then filtered for clouds and the remaining images
are converted into a timelapse gif using ImageMagick programmatically.


</p><br><span class="projecttitle">Krypt </span><a href="https://github.com/kylecs/hackpsu-fall-2017">(source code)</a><br><p>This is an Android App that allows you to send Bitcoin
from Coinbase to another person just by touching your phones
together. This is accomplished using the Coinbase API
and NFC in Android phones.
</p><p>This is not one of my standard side projects. My team and I created this
at the HackPSU Fall 2017 Hackathon. That means that we had 24 hours
straight to build the most useful and interesting piece of software
we could. Krypt won 3rd place out of 64 teams that submitted projects.
</p><p>My role in this project was interfacing with the Coinbase API, and integrating that functionality
with NFC and our app's interface.
